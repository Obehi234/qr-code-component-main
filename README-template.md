### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

The most significant skill I utilized was how to centralize divs/images on a screen.

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to learn more about CSS Flexbox and Grids to make more responsive designs.


### Useful resources

- [w3schools.com] - This helped me to confirm my doubts about center aligning items. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [https://blog.hubspot.com/] - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand how to center align images. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
